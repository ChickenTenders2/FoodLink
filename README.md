FoodLink: Smart Fridge Assistant

### BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM AND ITS OBJECTIVES


Feature

### HIGHLIGHT OF KEY FEATURES


Technology Stack:

- **Frontend** : HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend** : Python (Flask Framework)
- **Database** : MariaDB
- **IoT Integration** : Thingsboard API


Installation:

## Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi with Raspberry Pi OS
- Python 3.9+ and pip
- Virtualenv: `pip install virtualenv`
- Internet access
- Basic terminal and sudo access

---

## Extracting the Project from ZIP

Unzip the provided FoodLink project folder and navigate into it:

```bash
unzip FoodLink.zip
cd FoodLink
```

---

## Setting Up Python Virtual Environment

```bash
cd setup
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

## Installing Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Setting Up MariaDB on Raspberry Pi

### 1. Install MariaDB

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mariadb-server -y
```

### 2. Secure the Installation

```bash
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

Choose:
- Set root password
- Remove anonymous users
- Disallow remote root login
- Remove test database
- Reload privileges

---

### 3. Create User and Database

```bash
sudo mariadb
```

Inside the MariaDB prompt:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE foodlink_db;
CREATE USER 'foodlink_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'strongpassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON foodlink_db.* TO 'foodlink_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
```

---

## Importing the Database (provided schema)

```bash
sudo mariadb -u foodlink_user -p foodlink_db < setup/foodlink_schema.sql
```

---

## Ensure MariaDB is Running

```bash
sudo systemctl status mariadb
```

If it is not active, start it using:

```bash
sudo systemctl start mariadb
```

---

## Configuring the Web App

Update DB config in your Flask code (e.g. `.env`):

```python
DB_USER = "foodlink_user"
DB_PASSWORD = "strongpassword"
DB_NAME = "foodlink_db"
```

---

## Running the Application

```bash
cd ../web_app
python app.py
```

Visit: `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.

---

## Final Notes

- Keep your Raspberry Pi connected to ThingsBoard for IoT features
- Default port is 5000; can be configured in `app.py`
