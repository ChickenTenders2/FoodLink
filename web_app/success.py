    Sends a "success" telemetry message to ThingsBoard.

    This function:
    - Generates a unique client ID using UUID.
    - Creates a timestamped telemetry payload with the message "Added".
    - Connects to the ThingsBoard server via MQTT.
    - Sends the telemetry data.
    - Logs whether the send was successful or not.
    - Ensures the client is disconnected after the attempt.

    Logging:
        - Success or failure of the telemetry send.
        - Any exceptions encountered during the process.

    Note:
        - Uses hardcoded ThingsBoard server URL and device access token.
        - Uses a new MQTT client instance for each call to avoid conflicts.
