FoodLink: Smart Fridge Assistant


FoodLink is a combined physical and web-based bespoke IoT platform with one main goal: reduce food waste. As an add-on, it provides an affordable and environmentally friendly way for consumers to achieve this goal. 

We have implemented various features to help us achieve a variety of objectives that help to contribute to our overall goal with efficiency and innovation:

- Item management system utilising the camera sensor to add items ---> Aids in the management of food inventory using visual computing features such as YOLO object detection trained on a custom dataset and barcode recognition and decoding.

- Recipe system and shopping list ---> Simplifies meal preparation by suggesting recipes based on items with the nearest average expiry and recommending items that are about to expire as shopping list additions as a convenient way to replenish food stocks.

- Virtual notifications and physical alerts ---> Prevents food spoilage using alerts (LCD update and buzzer sounds) for whether the door is left open for two minutes is triggered based on if the distance (calculated by an ultrasonic sensor) is greater than the distance from the door to the back of the fridge after this time. Notifications displayed on the website and sent by email remind users if items are about to expire as well as notifying them if the fridge conditions (calculated by a temperature and humidity sensor) are outside of a user-set optimal range. 

- Admin system ---> Full customer support with a reporting system that can help to swiftly fix any error in item information. Items and recipes can be edited using the admin account as an efficient alternative to manual database querying. 

To access the website, either run the project locally (not secure) following the steps below or access the website securely at*:

\* ThingsBoard API login requests appear to be blocked on OpenShift so the temperature and humidity notifications will not work when accessing the website online. 

Technology Stack:

- **Frontend** : HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend** : Python (Flask Framework)
- **Database** : MariaDB
- **IoT Integration** : Thingsboard API

Installation:

## Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi with Raspberry Pi OS
- Python 3.9+ and pip
- Virtualenv: `pip install virtualenv`
- Internet access
- Basic terminal and sudo access

---

## Extracting the Project from ZIP

Unzip the provided FoodLink project folder and navigate into it:

```bash
unzip FoodLink.zip
cd FoodLink
```

---

## Setting Up Python Virtual Environment

```bash
cd setup
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

## Installing Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Setting Up MariaDB on Raspberry Pi

### 1. Install MariaDB

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mariadb-server -y
```

### 2. Secure the Installation

```bash
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

Choose:
- Set root password
- Remove anonymous users
- Disallow remote root login
- Remove test database
- Reload privileges

---

### 3. Create User and Database

```bash
sudo mariadb
```

Inside the MariaDB prompt:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE foodlink_db;
CREATE USER 'foodlink_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'strongpassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON foodlink_db.* TO 'foodlink_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
```

---

## Importing the Database (provided schema)

```bash
sudo mariadb -u foodlink_user -p foodlink_db < setup/foodlink_schema.sql
```

---

## Ensure MariaDB is Running

```bash
sudo systemctl status mariadb
```

If it is not active, start it using:

```bash
sudo systemctl start mariadb
```

---

## Configuring the Web App

Update DB config in your Flask code (e.g. `.env`):

```python
DB_USER = "foodlink_user"
DB_PASSWORD = "strongpassword"
DB_NAME = "foodlink_db"
```

---

## Running the Application

```bash
cd ../web_app
python app.py
```

Visit: `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.

---

## Final Notes

- Keep your Raspberry Pi connected to ThingsBoard for IoT features
- Default port is 5000; can be configured in `app.py`

Usage:

### HOW TO NAVIGATE THE WEBSITE AND USE FUNCTIONALITY

### 1. Login / Create Account

### 2. Email Verification

### 3. User Dashboard

### 4. Settings

### 5. Inventory

### 6. Add Items to Inventory (Manual, Barcode scanner, AI recognitions)
- When in the inventory, click 'Add Item'.

Adding Personal Items:
- Click 'Personal Items' to view items that you have created and only you can access. 
- Click on an item from the list to edit it.
- Click 'Add Item' to add the item to the inventory.
- Alternatively click 'Add Missing Item' to add an item that is not in your personal inventory
  or the items database and cannot be detected by the AI or barcode scanner methods.
- Complete each of the fields.
- Click 'Report Item' if you want admins to review the item that you added and potentially add
  add it to the system database. 

Barcode detection:
- This is the default scanning mode.
- Hold the barcode in front of the camera but keep the entire barcode within the frame.
- If an item is detected click 'Add Item' to add it to the inventory. 

AI Object Recognition (Experimental):
- Can currently detect Apples, Bananas, Oranges, Bell Peppers and Potatoes. We plan to further train the model
  to increase the accuracy of Orange detection.
- Check the box for AI Item Recognition.
- Hold the item close to the camera so the finer details are in view.
- If an item is detected click 'Add Item' to add it to the inventory.

- (NOTE: This mode is experimental and may not always be accurate. You can modify the fields before adding 
  the item in case of error. May need to adjust the angle of the item you are holding to gain more
  accurate results.)

Text Search:
- Click 'Add Missing Item' to open 'Add Personal Items'.
- Alternatively enter a search term in the search field and click on 'Search'.
- Select an item from the list of results.
- Verify that the quantity is correct and click 'Add Item' to add it to your inventory.
